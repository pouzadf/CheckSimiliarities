CheckSimilarities is a CLI project that highlights similarities between text from two files using Bert Model and AI algorithm.
It supports pdf, docx, rtf and text extension. However document created from word online won't work with this project.

To start the project you just need to run run.sh. It might be long as we need to download in the docker some IA libs 
that are heavy. On MacOSx you need to allocate to docker more than 8Go of RAM otherwise it will faill to collect Pytorch.


To run the tests for the project just run run_test.sh
