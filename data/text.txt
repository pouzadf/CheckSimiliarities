Null Island 

Null Island is a name for the area around the point where the prime meridian and the equator cross,  

located in international waters in the Gulf of Guinea (Atlantic Ocean) off the west African coast. 

[1] In the WGS84 datum, this is at zero degrees latitude and longitude (0°N 0°E), and is the location of a buoy.  

The name 'Null Island' serves as both a joke based around the suppositional existence of an island there, and also as  

a name to which coordinates erroneously set to 0,0 are assigned in placenames databases in order to more easily find and fix them.
